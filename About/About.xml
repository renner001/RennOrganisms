  <description>Renn microbes are invisibly small and have a peculiar connection to reality: \nAnchient stories speak of friends to the microbes. Their friends are always favored by luck and rarely see enemies at their gates. Yet their societies are plagued by infighting and mood swings. \nOne can't have everything, it seems.\nMultiple buildings and agricultural produce can be used to reduce the threat levels of event, e.g. raids at the expense of a increasing mood penalty.</description>
